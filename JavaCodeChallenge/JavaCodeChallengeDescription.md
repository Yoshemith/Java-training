### Write a phone number word decoder
Write a program in Java that'll accept a list of phone numbers with letters and convert it to a phone number with only digits.

Keep in mind that the phone numbers in the list will be backwards. For example, if you sent the program a list of phone numbers like:

* EVOL119008
* KSAT687008
* TSET345008
* KNIL223008
* ECIN777008

it should return: 

* (800)-911-5683
* (800)-786-8275
* (800)-543-8378
* (800)-322-5465
* (800)-777-6423

It shouldnâ€™t only convert letters to the digits they represent but also format the number correctly with parentheses and dashes.
